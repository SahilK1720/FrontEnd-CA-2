# FrontEnd-CA-2
- The Game is called Solitaire
- It is a single player game
- There are 4 screens - The start page, instruction page, game page and result page.

Note:
- Please open the game in full screen mode.
- Also the images and the sound in the beginning take some time to load, like the audio image especially on the first page, so please wait for few seconds to load all the images. It would take 5-10 clicks on the speaker icon to change, I don't know why but it definitely works. All this happens only opening it for the first time.
- This game is mostly computer/laptop preferred game and not for mobile UI.

Controls:
- Drag and drop the cards
- Press D to deal again


The intstructions to play the game are as follows:
- The game begins with cards already dealt into seven piles. Each pile has a face-up card, and the remaining deck forms the stock.
- Your goal is to move all the cards to the foundation piles in ascending order, separated by suit.
- Examine the seven tableau piles.
- You can move cards within these piles to reveal hidden cards.
- To move the cards, drag the card and drop it where you want to place the card.
- Identify the four foundation piles at the top. Start building them with Aces, following with 2s, 3s, and so on, up to Kings.
- Draw cards from the stock to the waste pile by clicking or tapping on the stock.
- Use the top card from the waste pile or draw additional cards when needed.
- Move cards within the tableau piles in descending order and alternating colors. For example, place a red 7 on a black 8 .
- Empty tableau spaces can be filled with a King or a sequence starting with a King.
- Move cards to the foundation piles in ascending order and by suit.
- The game is won when all cards are successfully moved to the foundation piles in the correct order.
- If there are no more moves available, press D to deal again and play to win.
