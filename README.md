The intstructions to play the game are as follows:

-Your goal is to move all the cards to the foundation piles in ascending order, separated by suit.
-Examine the seven tableau piles.
-You can move cards within these piles to reveal hidden cards.
-To move the cards, drag the card and drop it where you want to place the card.
-Identify the four foundation piles at the top. Start building them with Aces, following with 2s, 3s, and so on, up to Kings.
-Draw cards from the stock to the waste pile by clicking or tapping on the stock.
-Use the top card from the waste pile or draw additional cards when needed.
-Move cards within the tableau piles in descending order and alternating colors. For example, place a red 7 on a black 8 .
-Empty tableau spaces can be filled with a King or a sequence starting with a King.
-Move cards to the foundation piles in ascending order and by suit.
-The game is won when all cards are successfully moved to the foundation piles in the correct order.
-If there are no more moves available, press D to deal again and play to win.
